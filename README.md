Astro Church is a high-performance and deeply customizable theme for [**Astro**](https://astro.build/). This theme prioritizes speed, ease of use, and robust sermon organization.

## Why Astro Church?

Too many church websites are trapped on generic platforms that aren't built for ministry. The result? **Frustratingly slow load times, messy sermon archives, and expensive monthly fees.** Even worse, your content is often locked into a proprietary system you don't truly own.

The **Astro Church Theme** was created to break that cycle. It is a purpose-built solution designed to solve the specific digital hurdles churches face. By prioritizing speed, intuitive sermon organization, and open-source freedom, we've made it easier (and cheaper) to have a solid church website.
